 * Serves a member's own identity card after registration.
 *
 * There is no member account, so access is proved by the signed token issued on
 * the success screen. The token authorises one registration number for one
 * hour and is invalidated if the mobile number changes.
 *
 * The row is read with the service-role client because the visitor's own session
 * cannot see `members` at all - which is the point: Row Level Security keeps
 * member data private from the public. The signature is the authorisation, and
 * nothing is returned unless it matches.
